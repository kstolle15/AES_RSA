# AES_RSA
Cryptography application for comparing runtimes of RSA and AES algorithms

#### This Project is solely meant for academic purposes. 

## Things you will need to install before running
1. pycryptodome - this is a wrapper library used for importing OpenSSL with python programs
    - to install this run pip install pycryptodome
2. matplotlib and pandas - these imports will be used to graph the data
    - to install matplotlip run pip install matplotlib
    - to install pandas run pip install pandas

## Running the Program 
Everything is set up so that you just have to run the command: python3 driver.py 
(Note: This Program will run for a few minutes due to the number of tests ran)

There are two main tests. After each one has completed, a series of graphs should pop up displaying 
the recorded information.
